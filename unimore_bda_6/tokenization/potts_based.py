"""
This file is a vendored version of `Christopher Potts' tokenizer <http://sentiment.christopherpotts.net/tokenizing.html>`_, which the project's specifications require to use.

It has been altered to be used with Python 3.10, but the code is mostly the same.

=========================
Original module docstring
=========================

This code implements a basic, Twitter-aware tokenizer.

A tokenizer is a function that splits a string of text into words. In
Python terms, we map string and unicode objects into lists of unicode
objects.

There is not a single right way to do tokenizing. The best method
depends on the application.  This tokenizer is designed to be flexible
and this easy to adapt to new domains and tasks.  The basic logic is
this:

1. The tuple regex_strings defines a list of regular expression
   strings.

2. The regex_strings strings are put, in order, into a compiled
   regular expression object called word_re.

3. The tokenization is done by word_re.findall(s), where s is the
   user-supplied string, inside the tokenize() method of the class
   Tokenizer.

4. When instantiating Tokenizer objects, there is a single option:
   preserve_case.  By default, it is set to True. If it is set to
   False, then the tokenizer will downcase everything except for
   emoticons.

The __main__ method illustrates by tokenizing a few examples.

I've also included a Tokenizer method tokenize_random_tweet(). If the
twitter library is installed (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)
and Twitter is cooperating, then it should tokenize a random
English-language tweet.

# The following strings are components in the regular expression
# that is used for tokenizing. It's important that phone_number
# appears first in the final regex (since it can contain whitespace).
# It also could matter that tags comes after emoticons, due to the
# possibility of having text like
#
#     <:| and some text >:)

# Most imporatantly, the final element should always be last, since it
# does a last ditch whitespace-based tokenization of whatever is left.
